create table grades ( id serial primary key, g int, name text); 


insert into grades (g, name  ) select random()*100, substring(md5(random()::text ),0,floor(random()*31)::int) from generate_series(0, 500);

-- Trick: want to get the approximately of total rows 
-- use EXPLAIN select * from grades;
-- don't use count, it will eats up all the resource
-- usecase: running adhoc script, running migration, etc

vacuum (analyze, verbose, full);

explain analyze select id,g from grades where g > 80 and g < 95 order by g;
